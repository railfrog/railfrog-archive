  <p>RailFrog is a fully modular system - almost everything will be a
    plugin, only the most central stuff is in the core. The main
    interface for controlling plugins, including: <ul>
      <li>locating plugins</li>
      <li>downloading plugins</li>
      <li>installing plugins</li>
      <li>selecting/enabling plugins - and versions</li>
      <li>removing unused plugins</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    When the plugin system is developed and tested, the current 'core'
    code will be refactored to use it. For now, it's all in the
    (RailsEngine) core.
