== Railfrog

Railfrog is a user-friendly, open-source website deployment and 
content management system built with Ruby on Rails, producing 
well structured and standards-compliant pages with Web 2.0 goodness. 
Railfrog makes it easy for developers, designers, webmasters, or 
just about anyone else to deploy and manage a website.

=== How to create new site

You can find an example at vendor/plugins/railfrog/db/sites/railfrog 

To load example site from the file system run 

  rake railfrog:site:load SITE=vendor/plugins/railfrog/db/sites/railfrog


=== Localization of Railfrog Control Panel

By default you have English version of Railfrog Control Panel. If you'd like 
to have localized version of UI you can easily localize Railfrog. Railfrog uses 
Globalite plugin (http://code.google.com/p/globalite/). To localize Admin UI 
you can just copy one of existing localization files eg:

  cp vendor/plugins/railfrog/lang/ui/ru.yml lang/ui

and add following line to your config/environment.rb file:

  Globalite.language = :ru

If you'd like to contribute localization file please send it to railfrog mailing list:

  railfrog-dev@googlegroups.com


==== History

Railfrog has been under development since June 2005, six months before
Rails 1.0 was released. That means there's a lot of cruft, which we try
to clear out and/or keep up to date -- but we need help with this :-)

You'll find previous experimental work in svn -
    svn -r 434 co https://svn.versiondude.net/railfrog/cms/railfrog/branches
