		  <p>RailFrog is a user-friendly, open-source web site deployment and content 
			management system built with Rails; producing well structured and standards-compliant 
			pages with Web 2.0 goodness.</p>

		<h2>A modest proposal</h2>
    <p>I&rsquo;m endeavoring to help jumpstart the development of an open-source 
      CMS application, built using <a class="xlink" href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Ruby 
      on Rails</a>, that will will empower writers, editors, publishers, designers, 
      developers, and site owners with the ability to make their websites <strong>work 
      <em>for</em> them.</strong> Named RailFrog, this application will endeavor 
      to be what Tom Peters calls a <a class="xlink" href="http://www.tompeters.com/tpc/wow_projects.php">WOW! 
      Project</a> and help the Rails framework and community more quickly reach 
      its &ldquo;tipping point.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>It is my desire to get this project going and contribute in any appropriate way. I&rsquo;m coming from a designer/developer&rsquo;s perspective and
		 I hope the Rails community and those already working on Rails CMS applications can benefit from this fledgling, but sincere effort.

		 if you&rsquo;d like to help with (or even lead) this effort.</p>
		
		<h2>What will RailFrog be?</h2>
		<p>Fulfilling <a class="xlink" href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000365.php">Jeffery 
		  Veen&rsquo;s CMS wishlist</a> wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad place to start. Here&rsquo;s an adaptation of that list:</p>

		<ol>
		<li>It will be easy to install.</li>
		<li>It will be easy to get started.</li>
		<li>It will be powerful, flexible and won&rsquo;t impose any content or structural preconceptions on the designer/developer.</li>
		<li>It will be easy to build a site that end users will never know (either visually or structurally) is powered by RailFrog (unless you want them to).</li>
		<li>It will feature task-based tutorials (created first) backed up by comprehensive feature documentation.</li>

		<li>It will make clear distinctions between the interfaces for content management users (writers, editors, publishers) and site development users (designers, developers, owners).</li>
		<li>It will implement web user interface improvements using Ajax.</li>
		<li>It will produce well-structured and standards compliant pages.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2>Short-Term Goals:</h2>
		<ol>		
			<li>Develop this website to function as a full communication vehicle (ala <a class="xlink" href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">rubyonrails.com</a>)</li>

			<li>Attract participants and organize interested people</li>
			<li>Begin to clarify project scope and goals</li>
			<li>Develop to the point where RailFrog.com becomes the first RailFrog site</li>
			<li>Deploy beta version to users for feedback and testing</li>
		</ol>
			
		
		<h2>What is needed?</h2>

		<p>An organized effort made up of passionate, capable people is needed from the likes of:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Developers experienced with open-source projects (I&rsquo;m not)</li>
			<li>Ruby on Rails programmers (I&rsquo;m not)</li>
			<li>Web Designers and Developers</li>

			<li>People with web-based CMS application experience</li>

			<li>Anyone who believes they can contribute in a meaningful way</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2>Why me, why now?</h2>
		
		<p><strong>I am not a programmer</strong>, but I am a designer/developer (among other things). I think something great like RailFrog will only come about from the efforts of a cooperative team of programmers, developers, 
		designers coming together to create something they can all be proud of. I&rsquo;d like to be a part of such a team.</p>

		<p>I believe that Rails is the best framework for such an effort and that the convergence of people, technology and events, 
		is happening to make this an ideal time for this type of open-source effort.</p>
		
    <p>Currently, I&rsquo;m one of the stewards of a niche <a class="xlink" href="http://www.c3mediagroup.com">media 
      company</a> and I represent (what I believe is) the core target user of 
      RailFrog. I wear many hats throughout the day (businessman, designer, videographer, 
      web developer, editor, writer, publisher, etc.) and have been desparately 
      looking for, and been frustrated in my efforts to find, a CMS that makes 
      me smile (<a class="xlink" href="http://www.textpattern.com">TextPattern</a> 
      has come closest). I want a solution that will help me create sites that 
      support our efforts, without having to get deeply mired in all the intricacies 
      of deployment, structure and all other complexities involved. I don&rsquo;t 
      believe a great solution exists yet.</p>

		<p>I want to help create just such a solution.</p>

			<li>Although I&rsquo;m a fairly early adopter in the Rails community (bought the <a class="xlink" href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html">beta-combo book</a>,

			and I hope we can somehow consolidate efforts to make a great app (even if RailFrog falls by the wayside in favor of something better.)</li>

		<h2>Let&rsquo;s Get the Ball Rolling</h2>

		<p>My motivation is to get the ball rolling. I&rsquo;ve got a (more than) full-time work load already, a family of six to nurture, and various other time commitments; but I&rsquo;m willing to spend
		time, energy and resources to help see this project develop. <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#114;&#112;&#105;&#101;&#114;&#99;&#101;&#64;&#114;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#102;&#114;&#111;&#103;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">Let me know</a>
