# RailFrog sample database config. If you use the same login for dev,
# test and production then you can set username and password here and
# re-use it on the other blocks.  See the README for notes on creating
# your databases.  The RailFrog team are currently supporting two
# databases: PostgreSQL 7.4+ and MySQL 4.x+.  Specify 'adapter' as
# 'postgresql' or 'mysql'.

login: &login
  adapter: mysql
  host: localhost
  username: railfrog
  password: ribbet!

# If you have created databases railfrog_development,
# railfrog_test and railfrog_production, and set up
# user and password as above, you don't need to change
# any of the settings below.

development:
  database: railfrog_development
  <<: *login
  
# Warning: The database defined as 'test' will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run 'rake'.
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
  database: railfrog_test
  <<: *login

production:
  database: railfrog_production
  <<: *login
